# HelloSwift
An app that teaches you SwiftUI interactively

Project is an unfinished concept app, so it does crash sometimes, but please feel free to download and tinker with it! üòÅ

If you do download it, you can play with any of the four mini-apps, but note the following: After you switch into SwiftUI mode and tap on UI elements, you'll see a modal pop-up showing the code used to generate the UI element; this code is usually accurate and sometimes tappable, and will take you to official Apple documentation for that code. However, only the following should be tapped (otherwise, the app will crash):

- VStack
- Text
- Button
- Image
- .resizable()
- .scaledToFit()
- .padding()

Hope you enjoy our project! To learn about our motivations and thought process, check out our audio blog here (includes transcripts):
